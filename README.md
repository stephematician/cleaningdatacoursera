This is the repository for the project for *Getting and Cleaning Data*, a
course run by John Hopkins University via [coursera](http://www.coursera.org).

The output is generated by running the script `run_analysis.R` in Rstudio. This
will
1. download the UCI HAR data into the `./data/` sub-directory;
2. extract the contents of the archive;
3. merge the test and training data into a single tidy dataset, extracting
only the mean and standard deviation components of the feature vector; and
4. generate a summary (tidy) dataset which contains the average of the mean
and standard deviation variables grouped by subject and activity.

The extracted data (without averaging) is stored in `output/UCI_HAR_ms_tidy.txt`
while the summary (averaged) data is found in `output/UCI_HAR_ms_averages.txt`,
both are generated using the `write.table()` function in R.

The description of the datasets is given in `codebook.md`.

Alternatively, the bash script `run_analysis` can be used, which simply runs
`run_analysis.R` using Rscript.

* `download_UCI_data.R` contains the code for downloading, and is invoked by
`run_analysis.R`
